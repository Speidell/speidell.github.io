Course description:
"This course focuses on the most basic principles of pharmacology and covers, in detail, molecular and cellular drug targets, drug-receptor interactions, agonism, antagonism, drug metabolism, pharmacogenomics, and pharmacokinetics. Quantitative problem-solving regarding these topics will be required. An introduction to several important neurotransmitters/receptors and their signaling mechanisms is included" Source: Georgetown University
