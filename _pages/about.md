Research Overview
I am a Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscientist focused on the complex mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. My work primarily investigates the pathological progression of Huntington’s Disease, utilizing sophisticated mouse models to bridge the gap between genetic triggers and phenotypic outcomes.

By combining anatomical neuroscience with high-resolution data analysis, I aim to map the structural and functional changes that occur during disease states. My research interests include:

Huntington's Disease: Exploring the molecular pathways that lead to neuronal dysfunction and death.

Neurodegeneration: Identifying conserved mechanisms across various movement disorders to find novel therapeutic targets.

Mouse Models: Leveraging transgenic models to study disease progression in vivo.

Anatomical Neuroscience: Utilizing neuroanatomical mapping and 'omics' analysis to understand circuit-level changes in the brain.
