I am a Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscientist focused on the complex mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. My work primarily investigates the pathological progression of Huntington’s Disease, utilizing cell free, *in vitro*, and mouse models to bridge the gap between genetic triggers and phenotypic outcomes.

By combining anatomical neuroscience with high-resolution data analysis, I aim to map the structural and functional changes that occur during disease states. My research interests include:

Huntington's Disease: Exploring the molecular pathways that lead to neuronal dysfunction and death.

Neurodegeneration: Identifying conserved mechanisms across various movement disorders to find novel therapeutic targets.

Mouse Models: Leveraging transgenic models to study disease progression in vivo.

Anatomical Neuroscience: Utilizing neuroanatomical mapping and 'omics' analysis to understand circuit-level changes in the brain.
