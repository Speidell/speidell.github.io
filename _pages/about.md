I am a molecular and behavioral neuroscientist who is focused on the complex set of mechanisms which underly neurodegeneration. Currently, my work investigates the molecular pathogenesis of Huntington’s Disease, with a special focus on the changing epigenetic landscape in early states of disease progression. To this end, I utilize cell-free experiments, *in vitro* approaches, and a variety of mouse models to bridge the gap between (epi)genetic triggers and phenotypic outcomes.

By combining anatomical neuroscience with high-resolution data analysis, I aim to map the structural and functional changes that occur during disease states. My research interests include:

Huntington's Disease: Exploring the molecular pathways that lead to neuronal dysfunction and death.

Neurodegeneration: Identifying conserved mechanisms across various movement disorders to find novel therapeutic targets.

Mouse Models: Leveraging transgenic models to study disease progression in vivo.

Anatomical Neuroscience: Utilizing neuroanatomical mapping and 'omics' analysis to understand circuit-level changes in the brain.
