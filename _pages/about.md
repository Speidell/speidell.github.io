I am a molecular and behavioral neuroscientist who is focused on the complex set of mechanisms which underly neurodegeneration, especially those which affect synaptic transmission. Currently, my work investigates the molecular pathogenesis of Huntington’s Disease, with a focus on the heavily distrupted epigenetic landscape in the early stages of disease progression. To do so, I utilize a variety of computational approaches, cell-free experiments, *in vitro* systems, and an array of mouse models to bridge the gap in understanding between (epi)genetic modifications and phenotypic outcomes.


Some exciting images from my current and previous work:

    <strong>Figure 2: Reduced expression of the pan-proneurotrophin receptor p75NTR restores expression of the immediate early gene cFos in the hippocampus of gp120 transgenic mice during recall of an extinguished fear conditioning task. </strong> Expression of cFos is reduced in the hippocampus of gp120tg mice during recall of an extinguished association vs WT, but restored in mice lacking one p75NTR allele in the same experimental epoch.
