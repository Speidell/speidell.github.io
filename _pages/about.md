I am a molecular and behavioral neuroscientist who is focused on the complex set of mechanisms which underly neurodegeneration, especially those which affect synaptic transmission. Currently, my work investigates the molecular pathogenesis of Huntington’s Disease, with a focus on the heavily distrupted epigenetic landscape in the early stages of disease progression. To do so, I utilize a variety of computational approaches, cell-free experiments, *in vitro* systems, and an array of mouse models to bridge the gap in understanding between (epi)genetic modifications and phenotypic outcomes.

By combining anatomical neuroscience with high-resolution data analysis, I aim to map the structural and functional changes that occur during disease states. My research interests include:

Huntington's Disease: Exploring the molecular pathways that lead to neuronal dysfunction and death.

Neurodegeneration: Identifying conserved mechanisms across various movement disorders to find novel therapeutic targets.

Mouse Models: Leveraging transgenic models to study disease progression in vivo.

Anatomical Neuroscience: Utilizing neuroanatomical mapping and 'omics' analysis to understand circuit-level changes in the brain.
